Description for distributable package *.bento

TOARU/* used for configuration information. All these files should end in
newlines.
TOARU/setup used to run scripts at install/upgrade/removal time

Can be called with arguments depending upon situation:
  ./setup prepare $OLD_VERSION $NEW_VERSION    -- called before dependencies are installed
  ./setup install $OLD_VERSION  $NEW_VERSION   -- called before files are copied
  ./setup configure $OLD_VERSION  $NEW_VERSION -- called after files are copied
  ./setup prepare-remove $OLD_VERSION          -- called before remove takes place
  ./setup remove $OLD_VERSION                  -- called after files on filesystem are removed

In case the package is not already installed the old_version will just be "-1"

TOARU/name Name of the package. Example: libpng0
TOARU/version Version of the package. The only dividing characters between
  version specifiers are '.' and '-' and significance is from left to right
  regardless of the divider used. Example: 1.0.2-0
TOARU/depends Dependencies of the package. Each dependency is listed on its own
  line along with a version specifier. Using '*' for the version specifier
  means "any version". Using '>', '<', '>=', '<=', or '=' before a version
  means the package depends on a specific set of versions of the package.

  Example:
  libpng0 >1.0
  libzlib0 *
  libarchive0 <=2.5.3-2
TOARU/architecture The architecture of the package. Only valid values now are
  "i386" or "any". "any" is meant for packages that don't have any kind of
  architecture dependency such us a collection of desktop wallpapers.
TOARU/format Is a version number for the package format. Only valid value now
is 1.

The rest of the files in the package are simply merged into the filesystem.
The ownership and permissions of these files are the same as what are in the
archive, so using something like fakeroot to build the package would make
sense.

The packaging file itself is just a gzipped tarball of the file structure
described above.
